Desk Phone Utility
==================

This little utility allows to remotely control `snom <https://www.snom.com/>`_ VoIP
desk phones. In particular, it was tested using a
`snom D717 <https://www.snom.com/en/products/desk-phones/d7xx/snom-d717/>`_.

The primary application of the utility is using it to open ``tel`` and ``callto`` URIs
from the browser.

`fjung.com/desk_phone_utility <https://fjung.com/desk_phone_utility>`_, the source code at
`github.com/fxjung/desk_phone_utility <https://github.com/fxjung/desk_phone_utility>`_.
